        <h1>The Draycore Incursion</h1>
        <h2>A Very Realistic Interview</h2>
        
        <p>A quick <span class="strikethrough">and thoroughly made-up</span> chat between the Author <span class="title-interviewee">&#40;A&#41;</span> and an unimpressed interviewer <span class="title-interviewer">&#40;I&#41;</span></p>
        
        <p><span class="title-shift title-interviewee">A:</span>So there’s this alien.</p>
        <p><span class="title-shift title-interviewer">I:</span>Right.</p>
        <p><span class="title-shift title-interviewee">A:</span>He’s quite big.</p>
        <p><span class="title-shift title-interviewer">I:</span>Ok..</p>
        <p><span class="title-shift title-interviewee">A:</span>Anyway, so the background is that he’s a dissident. He doesn’t agree with the practises of his people - the Draycore. Those practises happen to involve destroying or enslaving the populations of the inhabited planets they come into contact with.</p>
        <p><span class="title-shift title-interviewer">I:</span>Right so he’s a big dissident alien, and why would I read this thing?</p>
        <p><span class="title-shift title-interviewee">A:</span>Well, erm, apart from the exceptional writing techniques employed by the author *cough* *cough* you can expect daring encounters with both evil and wise aliens and humans, as well as some likely ridiculous notions about the future of power in the Universe.</p>
        <p><span class="title-shift title-interviewer">I:</span>Sounds ... great. When can we get hold of it.</p>
        <p><span class="title-shift title-interviewee">A:</span>Not for a while yet. I’m planning on releasing a chapter a month on this site and taking feedback on what people enjoy about the story or places they think it could be improved.</p>
        <p><span class="title-shift title-interviewer">I:</span>What brought this idea on? Why not write it in private and then find a publisher and get it into stores if it’s good enough?</p>
        <p><span class="title-shift title-interviewee">A:</span>Well, for starters, I have no clue if it’ll be good enough, and whether people will actually like it. I’d be happier finding out if it’s crap, and whether I need to just move on, sooner rather than later! However, as a bigger point, I guess it’s a suggestion of a different method of writing. Socrates put an argument forward that the written word cannot defend itself - this idea seems to question everything that our society is based upon. Today, we believe that a collection of written knowledge is a massively positive thing - but maybe with the rise of a multi-way dialogue about content, we might be seeing a shift at a similar scale as that of the introduction of the printing press. The Printing Press allowed anyone with access to print anything they wanted, be that something for the advancement of our race or something purely farcical, it didn’t matter. With the advancement of the internet we can now have conversations with our authors, we can question them incessantly about their motives and their reasoning. I’m not saying we’ve solved Socrates’ issue with the written word - by beginning to let it be questioned - just that it’s an interesting evolution of the problem.</p>
        <p>So ... now I’ll stop pretending I’m doing anything wonderful or actually any different from every blogger out there today. It’s just an experiment, let’s see what comes out of it.</p>
        <p><span class="title-shift title-interviewer">I:</span>Well that got quite deep there for a second.</p>
        <p><span class="title-shift title-interviewee">A:</span>Yes, sorry about that. Won’t happen again.</p>
        <p><span class="title-shift title-interviewer">I:</span>Yes, hope not.</p>
        <p><span class="title-shift title-interviewee">A:</span>Right, so anything else you want to know?</p>
        <p><span class="title-shift title-interviewer">I:</span>Any more ideas for new books?</p>
        <p><span class="title-shift title-interviewee">A:</span>Let me finish this thing - whatever it is - then I’ll figure that out.</p>
